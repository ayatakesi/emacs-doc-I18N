"WoMan is a browser for traditional Unix-style manual page documentation.  "
"Each such document is conventionally referred to as a @dfn{manual page}, or "
"@dfn{man page} for short, even though some are very much longer than one "
"page.  A man page is a document written using the Unix ``man'' macros, which "
"are themselves written in the nroff/troff text processing markup language.  "
"@code{nroff} and @code{troff} are text processors originally written for the "
"UNIX operating system by Joseph F. Ossanna at Bell Laboratories, Murray "
"Hill, New Jersey, USA@.  They are closely related, and except in the few "
"cases where the distinction between them is important I will refer to them "
"both ambiguously as @code{roff}."

"@code{roff} markup consists of @dfn{requests} and @dfn{escape sequences}.  A "
"request occupies a complete line and begins with either a period or an "
"apostrophe.  An escape sequence is embedded within the input text and begins "
"(by default) with a backslash.  The original man macro package defines 20 "
"new @code{roff} requests implemented as macros, which were considered to be "
"sufficient for writing man pages.  But whilst in principle man pages use "
"only the man macros, in practice a significant number use many other "

"The distinction between @code{troff} and @code{nroff} is that @code{troff} "

"similar to a teletypewriter (usually abbreviated to ``teletype'' or "
"``tty'').  Hence, @code{troff} supports much finer control over output "
"positioning than does @code{nroff} and can be seen as a forerunner of "
"@TeX{}.  Traditionally, man pages are either formatted by @code{troff} for "
"typesetting or by @code{nroff} for printing on a character printer or "
"displaying on a screen.  Of course, over the last 25 years or so, the "
"distinction between typeset output on paper and characters on a screen has "
"become blurred by the fact that most screens now support bit-mapped "
"displays, so that any information that can be printed can also be rendered "
"on screen, the only difference being the resolution."

"Nevertheless, Unix-style manual page documentation is still normally browsed "

"predefined set of directories for the man page matching a specified topic, "
"then either formats the source file by running @code{nroff} or recovers a "
"pre-formatted file, and displays it via a pager such as @code{more}.  "
"@code{nroff} normally formats for a printer, so it paginates the output, "
"numbers the pages, etc., most of which is irrelevant when the document is "
"browsed as a continuous scrollable document on screen.  The only concession "

"I began developing WoMan in the Spring of 1997 and the first version was "

"many GNU and Unix programs are ported to other platforms and come with "
"Unix-style manual page documentation.  This may be difficult to read because "
"ports of the Unix-style @code{man} program can be a little awkward to set "
"up.  I decided that it should not be too hard to emulate the 20 @code{man} "
"macros directly, without treating them as macros and largely ignoring the "
"underlying @code{roff} requests, given the text processing capabilities of "
"Emacs.  This proved to be essentially true, and it did not take a great deal "

"proportion of the man pages that I have tested, either well or at least "
"readably.  However, I have added capabilities partly by making additional "
"passes through the document, a design that is fundamentally flawed.  This "
"can only be solved by a major re-design of WoMan to handle the major "
"formatting within a single recursive pass, rather than the present multiple "
"passes without any significant recursion.  There are some @code{roff} "

"several display faces to support bold and italic text, to indicate other "
"fonts, etc.  The default faces are also colored, but the choice of faces is "
