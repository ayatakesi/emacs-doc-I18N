"nXML mode is designed to support the creation of standalone XML documents "
"that do not depend on a DTD@.  Although it is common practice to insert a "
"DOCTYPE declaration referencing an external DTD, this has undesirable "
"side-effects.  It means that the document is no longer self-contained. It "
"also means that different XML parsers may interpret the document in "
"different ways, since the XML Recommendation does not require XML parsers to "
"read the DTD@.  With DTDs, it was impractical to get validation without "
"using an external DTD or reference to an parameter entity.  With RELAX NG "
"and other schema languages, you can simultaneously get the benefits of "
"validation and standalone XML documents.  Therefore, I recommend that you do "
"not reference an external DOCTYPE in your XML documents."

"One problem is entities for characters. Typically, as well as providing "
"validation, DTDs also provide a set of character entities for documents to "
"use. Schemas cannot provide this functionality, because schema validation "
"happens after XML parsing.  The recommended solution is to either use the "
"Unicode characters directly, or, if this is impractical, use character "
"references.  nXML mode supports this by providing commands for entering "
"characters and character references using the Unicode names, and can display "
"the glyph corresponding to a character reference."
