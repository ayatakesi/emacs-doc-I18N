Description:
Translating emacs documents from English to any other languages.

Howto-Use:
0. From emacs tarball, copy doc/ to repository's root.
   (If copy from savannah's clone, you may need at least run configure for creating emacsver.texi.)
1. Add language code(for example, ISO 639 language codes). to LINGUAS file(one line for one locale. for me this is 'ja').
2. Add document id to DOCUMENTS file.
   (I added "emacs" for Emacs manual. This id need not same to any file-system symbol like directory name.)
3. Create new file that lists document source files.
   IMPORTANT: This file must be named upper-case of document id added by stepw, and followed "_FILES" (I created EMACS_FILES).
4. Add document source files to ${document id}_FILES.
   (I added files by checking doc/emacs/Makefile.)
5. Run 'scripts/utility.sh gettextize'
   (Create pot files in 'C' locale directory.)
6. Run 'scripts/utility.sh msgint'.
   (Create po files in language code's directory by copying pot files.)
7. Tranlate them.
   (It may take some time ;-)
8. Run 'scripts/utility.sh translate'.
   (Create localized texi in language code directory that will be created under original texi files)
9. As time goes by, Emacs new version will be released, so copy doc/ directory like step 0.
10. Run 'scripts/utility.sh gettextize' like syep 5.
    (Update C/*.pot)
11. You MUST NOT run 'scripts/utility.sh msgint' like step 6.
    (If you do, your works will be lost.)
12. Run 'scripts/utility.sh msgmerge'.
    (Update po files by pot files and  po files that contains translations)
13. Goto step 7.
14. /* never reach here */
